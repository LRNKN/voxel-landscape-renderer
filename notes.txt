NOTES DURING MY STUDY OF WEBGL2
===============================

Taken from https://webgl2fundamentals.org/

A WebGL program is the combination of two things:
	A vertex shader, that computes vertex positions and can rasterize primitives
	A fragment shader, that compute a color for each pixel of a primitive

We can send the GPU data in any of the following ways:
	Buffers: arrays of binary data accessed in sequence
	Attributes: GPU input variables whose values are read in from buffers
	Vertex Array Object: the combined state of attributes and the buffers they read from
	Uniforms: global variables
	Textures: arrays of data that can be randomly accessed
	Varying: variables passed from the vertex shader to the fragment shader
